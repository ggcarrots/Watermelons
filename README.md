## Financial planning for our project

We are planning with a detailed expense and income plan for the first year of activity.
The detailed planning can be found in the Excel sheet attached in this repository ("2019-06-09_watermelons_financial_planning.xlsx").

### Cash runway

We have detailed expense plans (especially hiring and online campaigns to increase our reach). Roughly said, we will start with a team of five and minimal salaries; over time, we'll hire 1-2 new experts per quarter and increase salaries step by step as part of our staff binding strategy. Per month, we'll thus spend around EUR 4000 monthly at the beginning, and around EUR 14000 monthly towards the end of our first year.
We are planning with income from ad placements on our website, and provision of services and trainings, of around EUR 2000 to EUR 8000 per month during the first year.

Looking at the projected accumulated financial planning of our venture, this means that for the first year of activities, we would need funding of around EUR 70000 in order to survive as a venture.
